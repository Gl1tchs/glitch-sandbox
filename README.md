# Sandbox for me to learn graphics programming.

This project uses my own vulkan wrapper and framework to abstract away shaders,
descriptors,pipelines,synchronization and a lot more.

## Building and Running

### Requirements:
- clang
- glslc
- ninja

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gl1tchs/glitch-sandbox.git # clone the repository
cd glitch-sandbox # enter the directory
make # build it

```

## Examples

You can access each individual examples using keys 1-9.

## Notes

This project only works on x86_64 linux environment because the engine used is
closed source and i am very lazy to build it on other environments.
